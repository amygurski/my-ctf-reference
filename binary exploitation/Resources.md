# Binary Exploitation

Binary exploitation or 'pwn' challenges involve finding a vulnerability in a program and exploiting it.

CTF challenges in this category involve identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities to obtain the flag:

1. Heap Exploitation: This involves vulnerabilities related to heap memory management, such as heap overflows, use-after-free, double free, and heap spraying techniques.

2. Return-Oriented Programming (ROP): ROP attacks bypass data execution prevention (DEP) and code execution prevention (ASLR) by utilizing existing code snippets (gadgets) to chain together a series of instructions to achieve arbitrary code execution.

3. Shellcode Injection: In this type of challenge, you may need to inject and execute custom shellcode to gain control over the target system.

4. Race Conditions: These challenges involve exploiting timing vulnerabilities in multi-threaded or multi-process applications to gain unintended access or control.

5. Off-by-One Errors: These occur when a buffer is not correctly sized, allowing us to overwrite adjacent memory.

6. Stack Smashing Protection (SSP) Bypass: This involves bypassing security mechanisms like stack canaries (a random value placed on the stack to detect buffer overflows) and other mitigations.

7. Memory Corruption: This includes various types of memory corruption vulnerabilities like stack buffer overflows, stack-based and heap-based buffer overflows, and integer overflows.

8. Format String Attacks: These occur when an application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied format strings, allowing an us to manipulate the program's memory and execute arbitrary code.

9. Kernel Exploitation: Some CTF challenges involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system's kernel, such as privilege escalation or bypassing security mechanisms.

10. Binary Patching: These challenges require analyzing and modifying binary code to achieve a specific outcome, such as bypassing license checks or altering program behavior.

In my experience, binary exploitation CTFs require a solid foundation in Assembly Language, Computer Architecture, and the C programming language. This was challenging for me having come to software development from a coding bootcamp but after trying to jump into a few pwn CTFs I quickly realized its essential to tackling these challenges. They also require python scripting for writing the exploit scripts. As I've gotten more experienced using my decomplier of choice (Ghidra, because it's free) I've realized understanding how to use it - e.g. to make my decompliled code look more like C, give variables meaningful names, etc - is immensely helpful too.
